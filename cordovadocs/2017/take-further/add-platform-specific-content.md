# Add platform-specific content to your Cordova project

Tailor your app to specific platforms with images, functions, styles, and configuration files.

## <a id="VisualAssets"></a>Add platform-specific visual assets

Add visual assets such as icons and splash screens for specific device resolutions and platforms to the **res** folder.

* The **res\icons\platform** subfolder contains the app icons for each platform.

* The **res\screens\platform** subfolder contains splash screens for each platform.

The file name of each resource provides some information about the asset. For example, the **screen-ldpi-portrait.png** file in the **res\icons\screens\android** folder represents a splash screen for a low-resolution screen (ldpi, or 426x320) for an Android device in portrait orientation.

For more information about icon assets, see [Icons](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/images.html).

To work with splash screen assets, see the [cordova-plugin-splashscreen plugin](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/).

Android supports a scalable type of image called a *NinePatch* and you can use it as your splashscreen.

To use a NinePatch splashscreen image on Android:

1. In the **config.xml** file, change ```<preference name="SplashScreen" value="screen" />``` to ```<preference name="SplashScreen" value="splash" />```

2. Place the NinePatch image in the following location: res\native\android\res\drawable-nodpi\splash.9.png

   When you build your app, the image gets copied to the right output folder.

## <a id="Content"></a>Add platform-specific content

You can include platform-specific HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the **merges** folder of your project. The files you add to this folder do one of two things. They add content to a platform-specific build of your app, or, they override non-platform-specific content that uses the same file name.

For more information about using the **merges** folder, see [Using merges to customize each platform](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide/cli/#link-9) in the Apache Cordova documentation.

If you donâ€™t see the **merges** folder of your project in **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the project in **Solution Explorer**, choose *Add*, and then choose *Add Platform Specific Code* to add the folder.

## <a id="Configuration"></a>Add platform-specific configuration files

You can use the **res/native** folder in your project to inject content into the native project that is generated by Cordova when you build your app. This can be useful when you need to configure your app to support something Cordova itself does not expose. (Plugins that you add to your project will also automatically modify the custom version of these configuration files.)

We recommend that you avoid adding platform-specific configuration files when possible.

The following table provides specific information for each platform.

        <tr>
            <td>iOS</td>
            <td>Place a custom <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532829">build-debug.xcconfig</a> or <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532830">build-release.xcconfig</a> file in res/native/ios/cordova to override signing identities and other <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532831">build settings</a> for these configurations. <br><br>Place a custom <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532832">Info.plist</a> file in the res/native/ios/config.xml display name folder to override settings like splashscreens or icons. <br>The Info.plist filename must be renamed as follows: config.xml display name-Info.plist to update <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532834">iOS framework keys</a>. You can find a sample version of these and other files in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532835">cordova-ios</a> GitHub repository, or when using the remote agent under the ~/remote-builds/build number/cordovaApp folder on your Mac.</td>
