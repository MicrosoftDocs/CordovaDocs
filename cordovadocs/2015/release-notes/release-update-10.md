 This plugin integrates the Azure Mobile Engagement (AZME) SDK into your Cordova Application. It supports both reporting and push features.

### Default Cordova version is now 6.1.1

With this update, all new cordova projects will target cordova 6.1.1. However at the time of this writing cordova 6.2.0 has been released, and will be shown in the platforms dropdown list if you want to use it.

>Note: To learn more about what's new in cordova version see the release notes for [6.1.1](https://cordova.apache.org/news/2016/04/04/tools-release.html) and [6.2.0](https://cordova.apache.org/news/2016/05/24/tools-release.html)

### Deprecated support for cordova plugin registry

Cordova versions prior to 5.x used to Cordova Plugin Registry to install plugins, this method has been deprecated and no longer works. If your cordova project targets an old version we show a banner in the plugins dialog.

## Bug Fixes

As usual, we have some bug fixes in this release. Here are the highlights: 

### Win10 store packaging: missing .appxupload file

We commented this issue in [this post](https://microsoft.github.io/vstacoblog/2016/05/06/windows-store-packaging.html) we have reviewd the bug, and now the .appxupload is working as it should

### Some plugins cannot be added by ID

We found that third party plugins were not using the convention to specify a cordova section in package.json, so we process this as if the package was not a real plugin. Now we have updated the detection logic.
